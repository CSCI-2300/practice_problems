# Sales Tracker

## Objectives:

1. Practice Java coding conventions
1. Implementing user interaction through terminal
1. Utilizing static methods

## Project Description:

You're tasked with creating a sales tracking program for a small business. Write a Java program named SalesTracker.java that:

1. Asks the user for the total number of sales records to input.
1. For each sale, prompt the user to enter the following information:
   1. Product name
   1. Sale amount
   1. Commission rate (percentage of sale amount that the salesperson earns)
1. Calculates and displays the commission earned for each sale.
1. Calculates and displays the total commission earned.
1. Congratulate the user if the total commission earned is over $100, by printing "Great job!". Otherwise, print "Keep working hard!".

Include the following static methods in your code and use them to organize the program and reduce code duplication:

1. calculateCommission: Returns the commission earned for a sale. Accepts sale amount and commission rate as parameters.
1. printCommission: Accepts the product name, sale amount, and commission earned as parameters. Prints out the details of each sale.
